    <!-- Questions -->
    <h1><em>questions</em></h1>
    <p>
      I acknowledge that this code has many flaws, such as not being adjustable
      based on screen device (so having a smaller screen would cause the text
      and images to be formatted weirdly).
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of margin-left, I should have used another method. To change where
      the text is displayed on screen, what would you suggest? The "nbsp"
      property is also not the best: it gets very redundant, messy, and
      time-consuming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the format of the images are screwed up if you don't view it
      on full screen/a desktop width. What would you suggest to format images?
      (I wanted to limit CSS).
    </p>
    <p>
      Does the structure make sense with the meaning and story? Does it add to
      it/enhace it? Is it too distracting or not clear?
    </p>
